README file for Assignment 5 - InfiniteInt

# Assignment 5: InfiniteInt
The files in Assignment 5 consist of demo.cpp which is used as a test class to demo 
all methods defined within InfiniteInt.h and developed in InfiniteInt.cpp.

## To Compile and Run Program
1. To run the program add all files to the any same directory.
2. Navigate to the directory location and type the command 'make'
3. This will create an executable called 'DemoInfiniteInt'
4. Type 'DemoInfiniteInt' in command line and the program will execute.

## To Clean Program
To remove executable and any .o files run the command 'make clean' 
Warning! This will delete the executable and will require rerunning 'make' to retest it

## Code Organization
InfiniteInt.cpp implements all functions defined in InfiniteInt.h.

InfiniteInt.cpp will implement all operator overloads specified in the 
InfiniteInt.h header file.

Finally, demo. cpp will handle all commands given during program execution this is 
done through the use of the main() function.
